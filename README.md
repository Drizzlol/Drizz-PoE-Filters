# How To Use
WIP

Download whichever you intend to use and sounds folder. 


Put both in Documents > My Games > Path of Exile

Alternatively you can also follow my public filters list https://www.pathofexile.com/account/view-profile/Drizz-3461/item-filters or my Filterblade link https://www.filterblade.xyz/?profile=Drizz%233461&saveState=OMRYEHNKZMOIUL&isPreset=false&game=Poe2 You still need to download the sounds folder from here even if you follow on the pathofexile website


Check back before league start for potential updates
