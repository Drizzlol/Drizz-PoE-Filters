# BASE TTS FILTER AVAILABLE

Base filters show all armor types and weapons. 

If added through filterblade you can edit bases to hide/base's ranks.

# How To Use

**STEP 1:**

Download one of the filters below. 

**BASE FILTERS:**

```Drizz Comfy Filter:``` https://www.filterblade.xyz/?profile=Drizz%233461&saveState=FTKUVELR1MM45T&isPreset=false&game=Poe2

```Drizz Comfy Filter (No TTS):``` https://www.filterblade.xyz/?profile=Drizz%233461&saveState=UIICL77SFNKNXO&isPreset=false&game=Poe2

```Drizz Comfy Filter (Dark Mode):``` https://www.filterblade.xyz/?profile=Drizz%233461&saveState=CKHIN5FXA7BJ0N&isPreset=false&game=Poe2

**CLASS FILTERS**

```Drizz Ranger Filter (EV/ES):``` https://www.filterblade.xyz/?profile=Drizz%233461&saveState=FF3JDMALI6D8IV&isPreset=false&game=Poe2

**STEP 2:**

```Skip this step if you're using the Non TTS base```

Download the sounds folder. 

Put the sound files in your filter folder "Documents > My Games > Path of Exile"

**STEP 3: (Optional)**

If using a base filter you may want to hide bases you're not interested in, in the filterblade settings.
Can refine the ranks of any filter in the settings too.
