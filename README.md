# How To Use
WIP

Download whichever you intend to use and sounds folder. 


Put both in Documents > My Games > Path of Exile

Alternatively you can also follow my public filters list https://www.pathofexile.com/account/view-profile/Drizz-3461/item-filters. You still need to download the sounds folder from here even if you follow on the pathofexile website

Check back before league start for potential updates

If you have any feedback feel free to post in the filter feedback channel in discord here https://discord.gg/Cafnuub
